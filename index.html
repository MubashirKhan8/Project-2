        </th>
    </table>
    <ol>


        <li>Name and Concept
            "Sesto Elemento" translates to "Sixth Element" in Italian, a reference to carbon, which is the sixth element
            on the periodic table. This name highlights the extensive use of carbon fiber in the car's construction to
            reduce weight.</li>


        <li>Lightweight Design
            One of the most notable features of the Sesto Elemento is its ultra-lightweight body. The car weighs just
            999 kg (2,202 lbs) due to the heavy use of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) in its chassis, body
            panels, suspension components, and even the seats.The lightness is key to its exceptional speed and
            handling.</li>


        <li>Performance
            Powered by a 5.2-liter V10 engine, the Sesto Elemento delivers 570 horsepower.
            It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.5 seconds, with a top speed exceeding 300 km/h
            (186 mph).
            The lightweight build and high power-to-weight ratio make it one of the fastest and most agile Lamborghinis
            ever built.</li>


        <li>Track-Only Car
            The Sesto Elemento is not road-legal; it was designed strictly for track use. Lamborghini produced only 20
            units of this car, making it extremely rare and exclusive.</li>
        <li>Aerodynamics and Design
            The design is aggressive and futuristic, with sharp lines, prominent air intakes, and a massive rear
            diffuser. The entire car is designed for maximum aerodynamic efficiency, improving speed and stability on
            the track.
            Its minimalistic, race-focused interior has fixed bucket seats molded directly into the chassis, with very
            few creature comforts to keep the weight down.</li>


        <li>Innovation
            The Sesto Elemento represents Lamborghini’s commitment to innovation, particularly in the use of advanced
            materials like carbon fiber composites.
            It serves as a technological showcase for the brand’s future direction in supercar engineering.</li>

        <li>. Brand History
            Founded by Ettore Bugatti in 1909, Bugatti started as a company focused on luxury and racing cars. Ettore
            was an Italian-born engineer who combined performance with elegance and fine craftsmanship.
            The original Bugatti company became famous for its beautifully designed cars and numerous victories in
            motorsports, especially during the 1920s and 1930s.</li>


        <li>Revival by Volkswagen Group
            After going dormant for decades, Volkswagen Group revived Bugatti in the late 1990s, transforming it into a
            brand focused on producing hypercars with extreme performance and luxury.
            The first car under VW ownership was the Bugatti Veyron, which set a new standard for speed, technology, and

            Interiors are handcrafted, offering unparalleled customization options to meet the demands of elite buyers.
        </li>
        <li>Exclusivity and Price
            Bugatti cars are among the most expensive vehicles in the world, with prices ranging from a few million
            dollars for the Chiron and Veyron to tens of millions for one-off models like the La Voiture Noire.
            Production numbers are very limited, making Bugatti vehicles rare and highly collectible.</li>




        <li>Future and Electrification
            As the automotive world shifts toward electric power, Bugatti has begun exploring hybrid and electric
            technologies. The brand is expected to integrate these technologies into future models while maintaining the

            dominated the sport in the 1990s, winning multiple championships under famous drivers like Tommi Mäkinen.
            This success in rallying helped solidify the Lancer Evo’s image as a performance car, influencing its cult
            following in the car enthusiast community.</li>



        <li>Consumer Models
            While the Lancer Evolution series focused on high performance, the regular Mitsubishi Lancer was marketed as
            an affordable compact sedan, targeting everyday drivers.
            Popular models included the Lancer ES, SE, and GT, which offered reliable engines (1.5L-2.4L), decent fuel
            economy, and a comfortable ride.
